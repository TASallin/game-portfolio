Space Maze - A unity project created in a team of 5 during a game design class at Georgia Tech. It is an action-roguelike featuring procedurally generated layouts of hand-designed rooms and five levels of increasing difficulty. The player's objective is to clear rooms by pressing all buttons while avoiding enemies and traps and then defeat the boss of each floor to advance.

Latenite (In project-implementation folder) - An unreal engine project created in a team of 5 during a junior design class at Georgia Tech. It is a virtual novel style game designed to give incoming freshmen an introduction to the campus and help with time and money management. The main gameplay features are pop-up events with multiple choices and a map screen where players can choose buildings to spend resources at.

The Price of Wealth - A unity project over the course of a year, worked on primarily by me and also with a game development club at Georgia Tech.
It is a roguelite game in a college setting, primarily text based. This was the project I learned Unity Engine with, and as such some aspects of my inexperience then show up as bugs in the game.

Procedural Dungeons Project - A unity project created individually during a procedural content course at Georgia Tech. It features an algorithm that generates a random dungeon on a tile-based grid with customizable parameters for room quantity, size, hallway shape, intra-room patterns, and others. This project requires the Unity editor to view.
